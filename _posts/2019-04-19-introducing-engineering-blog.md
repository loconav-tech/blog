At **[Loconav](https://loconav.com)**, we engineer scalable systems at a high velocity. To do so, the software we develop and use must be simple to understand, simple to scale , and easily accessible. That’s why we support open source software. We take the help form best of the community, and contribute our best work back to the community.

We learn along the way from the community and intend to give back to the community the same way  . This is the first step towards it , an Engineering Blog where we share our achievements and our hardships while making fleet management easy for you. 

> Hello World ! We are **LocoNav** and We have arrived . 

We have more exciting projects in the works. And they’ll be highlighted here, first. We hope by sharing our learnings here will help someone in the need .
